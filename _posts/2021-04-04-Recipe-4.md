Data science projects are meant to be shared! Taking time to structure your projects in an understandable, reproducible way will save you lots of headaches when you share with colleagues/other units and when you take time away from a project and want to return.

### Version Control
Git is a version control system. GitHub is a cloud repository that utilizes Git.  Version control is necessary for making sure you don’t end up with 10 different files named ‘my_project_v1’, ‘my_project_exploring’, ‘my_project_final’, ‘my_project_definitely_FINAL’, etc etc. Here’s a [beginner guide to Git/Github](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-git-and-github-6fcd0f2d4ac6) from Towards Data Science. Scroll down to option 2, to make a repository on the website using their user interface.

### Virtual environment
[A guide to Python’s virtual environments](https://towardsdatascience.com/virtual-environments-104c62d48c54) (TDS), another [link with advice/tips](https://towardsdatascience.com/advice-and-tips-to-properly-work-with-virtual-environments-67bbad9ba5b6) here. Note that if you’re using Jupyter notebooks that your virtual environment won’t automatically be available within Jupyter. Here’s a [guide to making virtual environments available in Jupyter notebooks](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-virtual-envs/). An easy way to install a package management environment is by [downloading miniconda/anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (downside being you’ll be stuck with a lot of things you likely won’t ever need).

In short, virtual environments are important for developers that are working on multiple different projects with different dependencies. A virtual environment, from the onset, will not seem like a useful endeavor because it creates more friction in your work routine. However, just like the rest of the suggestions in this section, there will come the day where you become grateful for putting in the work to build a professional development environment for yourself and your team.

Let’s capture an example to help illustrate the purpose of virtual environments. Say you’re a developer working on multiple tools at the same time -- an older tool that you’re just doing some updates on with v1.2.3 of jinnytool in the PyPi library and a fresh new exciting tool that might also use jinnytool but v2.3.4. Additionally, old tool is using Python 2.7 and the “customer” likes it that way. New tool, will of course, use Python 3.6 or maybe even 3.8 or hey, how about Python 4! Life will become very complicated without separate virtual environments for each of the two projects. A smart, organized developer will activate and deactivate environments depending on which project she is working on at the time. This developer names one virtual environment `oldtool` and one `newtool` and they are using different installations of Python and when running `pip freeze` the different jinnytool versions are installed at that time. Not only does this help in development, this also matters when it comes to deployment. With an easy `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, you can easily generate a text file with the list of installed libraries and the versions that the user should be using for the desired, expected output.

### Structure (cookiecutter)
A standardized file format like cookiecutter is a must. Here’s another quick walkthrough of using the cookiecutter structure. Notebooks are used for exploring (not production), raw data is kept unchanged, and src holds your .py scripts.

### Notebooks vs Source Code
Some people love notebooks and others hate them. How you use them is up to personal preference. Most people agree that notebooks are great for data exploration, data visualization, and tinkering on new projects, but they can lead to bad habits like hidden state and poor code and unlike Python scripts are not transferable for replicable, production code. That said, sometimes you can add a lot of value to some organizations with just a Jupyter notebook and iPython widgets can give your notebooks some cool interactive capabilities!
