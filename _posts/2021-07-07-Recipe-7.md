## What is Feature Engineering
Improving your data quality through transformations is called feature engineering and can be extremely useful in improving the results of your model. For instance, using the text of a ticket number from the Titanic to infer whether a passenger belonged to first, second, or third class; or using the dimensions (length, width, height) of a building to calculate a slenderness ratio when trying to predict whether a building will collapse in an earthquake. Check out this excellent notebook of feature engineering techniques on the Titanic dataset and Towards Data Science article on many types of feature engineering (with examples!)

Feature engineering requires domain expertise and seeing past the data that’s immediately available to what story the data could tell. Good feature engineering takes time, but can squeeze out a few extra percentage points of accuracy from a classical machine learning model. Bad feature engineering can result in misrepresenting your data and hurting your results.

### Remove Non-Important Features
- Collinear -- double counting for a feature
- Extremely low t-value or all values are pretty much the same → keeping it only adds in noise
