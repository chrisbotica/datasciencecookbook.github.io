# A Cookbook for Technologists, by Technologists

<br/><br/>
### What this Cookbook is...and is not
In the era of great power competition, the Defense Department needs to be better at data. From acquiring data from our many sensors and systems, to storing, curating and cataloging that data and then effectively using that data, the DOD needs to better in order to effectively compete with our adversaries in the future. Data science problems exist in units at the edge of the formation, so problem solving and prototyping must happen at the edge. It is likely that the most transformative capabilities arise from operations at the “forward edge,” discovered by the sailors, soldiers, marines, airmen and guardians themselves in contexts far removed from centralized offices and laboratories. This cookbook exists to enable decentralized, bottom-up problem solving so that the best solutions can be combined with centralized, top-down enablers.

This cookbook is not an official Defense Department policy. It’s complimentary to the DoD acquisition process, and to the teammates working hard to continue to improve that system. This is not a guide to learning Python or Pandas (though we offer some resources we’ve found helpful). It’s not an all-inclusive list of things to think about.  It’s not a guide for commanders (though some may find it helpful). It’s a guide for going from problem to data science prototype.

### Why we Wrote This
Getting data science right for the DOD requires technical expertise, domain expertise, and operational experience.  Thoughtful and deliberate coordination and collaboration between the DOD’s subject matter experts, you, and leadership is necessary when making technical decisions and policy concerning data.

<br/><br/>
### Intended Audience
This book is meant to be consumed by product managers, data scientists, software developers, designers, and anyone who wants to help DoD build better solutions.

You may be coming here with some background in data science and/or interest in learning what more data science can do for your team.   As a project developer, you should have some coding background already in at least one language (we assume Python here but the concepts are transferable). Pro stackoverflow skills will get you far when applying  these recipes. You should also have an initial understanding of data science concepts.

For more experienced data scientists, we encourage you to skim relevant sections to fill in parts of the development stack that you’re not familiar with or refresh on best practices/techniques that you’ve forgotten.

<br/><br/>
### Our Assumptions
We think if you’re reading this you may fit one of the following descriptions:
- You are a new data scientist and coder, maybe have taken some courses, participated in a bootcamp, and can build scikit-learn models, but are not hand-crafting neural networks. You aren’t too certain of all the capabilities  out there.
- You are a more confident data scientist and coder, possibly with an academic background. You are aware of the capabilities of data science but haven’t worked on data science problems “in the wild”. Most of your experience is with structured  data and targeted problems. You’re looking to learn more about how to bring  the full workflow together.
- You have a background in product management / design / software development but not in data science, and you are now part of a team working on a data science project

### How to Use this Resource
Like any cookbook, flip to the recipe you need. We tried to make each subsection stand on its own and be consumable on its own. If you don’t understand a particular ingredient in the recipe, use the ingredients section to learn more.
