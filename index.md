# Welcome to the Data Science Cookbook!
A resource to help data scientists go from **problem to prototype**
<br>
_Author's note: This is still a work in progress..._
_We have tried our best to attribute all links and work. If we have failed to do so, or you wish for something to be removed, please let us know!_
<br/><br/>
## What
An open-source “cookbook” to enable bottom-up data science in DoD units at the edge of the formation. Help small teams get from 0 → 1.
<br/><br/>
## Why
Enablers of ML in DoD—infrastructure, funding, acquisition—are centralized.
Problems, problem solving, and prototyping—are decentralized.
<br/><br/>
**Purpose: merge top-down enablers with bottom-up problem solving**
<br/><br/>
## How
- _"Ingredients"_ → What goes in to the recipes (human capital, development environment, compute, data)
- _"Recipes"_ → Process. (defining the problem, data management, exploring data, building models, etc)
- Structure → bite-sized (<5 pg) articles
<br/><br/>

## Team
Data scientists, designers, and product managers with experience in DoD (AI Task Force, Maven, Kessel Run, Fort Meade, SOCOM, Harbinger and more)
<br/><br/>
## Audience
Operations Research Analysts, junior data analysts, data sciewntists, recent graduates of universities and grad school programs, bootcamp grads, product managers.
<br/><br/>
