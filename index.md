# Welcome to the Data Science Cookbook!
A resource to help data scientists go from **problem to prototype**


<p>&nbsp<p>
### What
An open-source “cookbook” to enable bottom-up data science in DoD units at the edge of the formation. Help small teams get from 0 → 1.
<p>&nbsp<p>
### Why
Enablers of ML in DoD—infrastructure, funding, acquisition—are centralized. 
Problems, problem solving, and prototyping—are decentralized.


**Purpose: merge top-down enablers with bottom-up problem solving**


<p>&nbsp<p>
### How
- "Ingredients" → What goes in to the recipes (human capital, development environment, compute, data)
- "Recipes" → Process. (defining the problem, data management, exploring data, building models, etc)
- Structure → bite-sized (<5 pg) articles


<p>&nbsp<p>
### Team
Data scientists, designers, and product managers with experience in DoD (AI Task Force, Maven, Kessel Run, Fort Meade, SOCOM, Harbinger and more)


<p>&nbsp<p>
### Audience
Operations Research Analysts, newly minted data science graduates, bootcamp grads, product managers.


<p>&nbsp<p>
### Caveats
These views and ideas are the authors' own and do not represent the views of the DoD, the Services, or any DoD organizations
