## Websites
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), a Medium blog with endless tutorials and code examples
    - Medium has a $5/month charge for unlimited articles. I’ve found this incredibly worth it. Or you just use the chrome incognito option...
- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com), a blog by Jason Brownlee, has great tutorials
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), a data science competition platform, has lots of great data sets and notebooks sharing users’ problem-solving process and code
- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), free coding classes for a ton of different languages. Great for brushing up on syntax if you need to switch languages.
- Twitter has a large data science community
    - The [DL/ML Twitter Loop](https://twitter.com/i/lists/811597808042180608/members) has some good ML people to follow
    - [Santiago](https://twitter.com/svpino) also has informative threads on ML and Python
